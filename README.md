Scrape_of_Duty_2
================

This was a Craigslist scraper built for the command line. It scrapes Craigslist for particular search parameters whenever it's run, sending an email with the relevant results.

It was the first group project from Dev Bootcamp. It was ultimately going to be inmplemented with the Twilio API and become a daily cron job, but neither were fully implemented by the end of the project.
